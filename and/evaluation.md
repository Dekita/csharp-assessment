# Project Management: 
The project management software we were suggested to use (project libre), I dont even know where to begin describing how terrible this application is. For the scope of the project, the requirement of 'project management' in itself is a huge waste of time and literally takes longer than writing the code does. (by a significant amount)

Project Libre has to be one of the most outdated programs I've used in the past decade (no exaggeration). Because of this, I opted to use a more modern solution (trello). Project management within trello is effortless, but again, for the scope of this project, a waste of time.  

# Requirements Report: 
Again, for the project scope, this felt like a huge waste of time. The project consists of reading a files contents and printing the data. Anything actually required is already detailed within the project description. 

# Design: 
Designing the program was incredibly easy. I debated adding an actual gui to the application because there was almost nothing to design otherwise. Instead I opted to keep the command line interface and used a simple text based ui. 

# Code: 
Writing the code for the program was easier than writing this document. 

The methods that we were requested/suggested to use are extremely outdated, and are essentially a means of 'reinventing the wheel' considering that there are actual standard functions available in the code classes to perform everything such as searching/sorting/filtering data. 

User password information should always be cryptographically secured, especially in a  learning environment. This is, in my oppinion, a huge oversight in the course material. 

# Testing: 
The program was tested while being written. Due to the small size of the project, no major testing sessionw as required. 


# Additional Notes: 
Please update the overall course material if possible. Most of the methods/functions/logic/programs/information given was substantially out of date. Entire weeks worth of lessons were spent on learning how to 'reinvent the wheel' as described above. This time would be much better spent actually learning how references work, or arrays, or how to create a custom class/object. 

Being someone who is familiar with the underlying principles of programming, I feel I could have completed this assessment after only 3-5 weeks of class. I hope that gives an idea of how much time is actually being wasted in this 12 week course. 

I do understand that most students have no previous programing knowledge, but I feel that only makes the fact that the material is outdated even worse. Students are being asked to learn how to do things that are entirely obsolete, when that time could instead be spend on the underlying fundimentals.
