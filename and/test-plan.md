# White Box Testing: 
White box testing involves validating the internal workings of a system. White box testing assumes that the path of the logic or program is known. This method of testing may also be called 'glass box', 'transparent box', 'clear box', or 'code base testing'. 

# Black Box Testing: 
Black box testing, unlike white box, only considers external behaviour of the application from an end-user perspective. The internal workings of the software are not taken into consideration. Black box testing can be applied to every level of software testing: unit, integration, system, and acceptance. 

# Grey Box Testing: 
Occasionally a QA engineer may review your code. They would have some knowledge of the source code. This can be reffered to as grey box testing. 


# Unit Tests: 
Check individual software components to ensure functionalities are being fulfulled. 
Unit tests will be carried out (by me) on each individual function.

# Integration Tests: 
Checks the flow of data from one module to another. 
Integration tests will be carried out (by me) on each individual module/class.

# System Tests: 
Evaluate the complete system to ensure both the functional and non functional needs.
System tests will be carried out (by me) after all other testing to ensure overall functionality of the application meets the clients requirements. 

# Acceptance: 
Ensure that the program meets specification/contract requirements. 
Acceptance tests will be carried out by the client (lecturer) to ensure all requirements have been met.

# Tests Completed: 
see tests.md


# Test Notes: 
All Unit, Integration, and System testing performed will technically be white box testing, as access to the source code is available, and has been written or modified by me. Acceptance testing will be considered Grey Box since the client (lecturer) does have knowledge of how the system should function, as well as access to the source code, but they did not write, nor maintain the source code. 

I feel like all testing performed (other than the final system tests) falls under unit or integration testing. Testing each individual function would be considered unit testing, which is what happened before the functions were assigned their own class, which then a single integration test was done to ensure funcitonality remained. Once all requirements are met, and all tests correct, the final system tests were done to ensure overall functionalities.
